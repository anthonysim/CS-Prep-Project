Notes
Tech Challenges: logic for the different combos, how to structure the game, keeping 
it DRY as possble. Communication, trying to compile ideas, but keeping time in mind.
Forgetting stupid things bracket notation, forgetting the "return"

Stretch features: mess around with it so a RICOTHZEE pops up more often, strict inputs,
a string is a string, a number is a number, etc, drum rolls, animation, up the ante, 
bonus challenges, etc.
